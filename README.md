# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day - React App Practice
In learning React, I followed Jennifer Snyder's [tutorial](https://medium.com/@jlsnyder09/how-to-use-react-to-display-nasas-astronomy-picture-of-the-day-283c01ff9e31) in creating a React app that displays NASA's astronomy photo of the day.

I've been playing around with the styling and I hope to implement new features to this app as I develop my React skills even furhter.

This React app was set up by following the instructions on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project generator developed by Facebook.
